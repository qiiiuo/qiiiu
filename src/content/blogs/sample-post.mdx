# Getting Started with Modern Web Development

This is a sample blog post demonstrating the blog system with MDX support.

## Introduction

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the years. In this post, we'll explore the key concepts and tools that define the current landscape.

## Key Technologies

### React and Next.js

React has become the de facto library for building user interfaces, and Next.js extends it with powerful features like:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-based routing

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling that enables rapid development without leaving your HTML.

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```typescript
export default function Button({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-black text-white rounded hover:bg-gray-800">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep components small and focused** - Each component should do one thing well
2. **Use TypeScript** - Type safety prevents bugs and improves developer experience
3. **Optimize performance** - Use lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization
4. **Write tests** - Ensure your code works as expected

## Conclusion

The modern web development ecosystem offers powerful tools for building fast, scalable applications. Keep learning and experimenting!
